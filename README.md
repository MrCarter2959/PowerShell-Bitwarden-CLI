# PowerShell-Bitwarden-CLI
Provides a PowerShell Interface to work with the Bitwarden CLI

Using https://github.com/ab0mbs/bitwarden-ad-rotation as a inspiration. After migrating from KeePass to Bitwarden, needed a way to interface with the CLI that was a little easier to read inside of scripts and would allow other team members to use it as well
